<p>Fruits are the sweet or sour, edible parts of plants that typically contain seeds. They usually develop from the flower of a plant and are often eaten raw.

There are different types of fruits, including:

Citrus fruits (e.g., oranges, lemons)

Berries (e.g., strawberries, blueberries)

Stone fruits (e.g., peaches, cherries)

Tropical fruits (e.g., mangoes, bananas)

Melons (e.g., watermelon, cantaloupe)

Fruits are a rich source of vitamins (especially vitamin C), minerals, fiber, and natural sugars. Regular consumption of fruits promotes good digestion, boosts immunity, and helps reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

They are commonly enjoyed fresh, juiced, dried, or in desserts and salads.</p>
