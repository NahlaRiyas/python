<p><margin>CHAMELEON:Chameleons are a distinctive and highly specialized group of lizards known for their color-changing ability, independently moving eyes, and long, sticky tongues used to catch prey. Most species are native to Africa and Madagascar, although they can also be found in parts of Asia and Europe. They typically change color for communication, temperature regulation, and camouflage.</p>
