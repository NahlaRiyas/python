<p>FTrees are large, woody plants that typically have a single main stem or trunk, branches, and leaves. They are among the oldest and tallest living organisms on Earth. Trees play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by producing oxygen, absorbing carbon dioxide, providing habitat for wildlife, and preventing soil erosion. They also offer shade, beauty, and materials such as wood, fruits, and medicines. Found in nearly every part of the world, trees are essential for both the environment and human life.</p>
