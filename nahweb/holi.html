        Holi known as the Festival of Colors, is celebrated across India in spring. People play with 
        colored powders and water, sing and dance, and enjoy festive sweets like gujiya. Holi 
        symbolizes the victory of good over evil and the arrival of spring.Holi is a lively, joyful celebration that breaks down social barriers and spreads happiness, unity, and love through colors. It’s a time to forgive, forget, and start fresh with friends and family.Holi usually takes place in March, on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Phalguna. The celebrations last for two days — the first night with the bonfire and the next day with colors.
