<p>Flowers are the colorful, often fragrant reproductive parts of flowering plants. They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, attracting pollinators like bees, butterflies, and birds. Flowers play a key role in plant reproduction by producing seeds. Beyond their biological function, flowers are also valued for their beauty and symbolismâ€”they are used in decorations, celebrations, and as expressions of emotions such as love, sympathy, and joy. Many flowers also have medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
